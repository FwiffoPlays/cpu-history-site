# CPU History Site

This project is for a static website built using HTML and CSS which aims to detail some of the history of the CPU and its development, remaining conscious of accessibility and responsiveness for a variety of devices.

## Features

The majority of the content within site is contained within a single scrolling page, including navigation buttons at the top of the page to jump to a specific section and a 'back to top' button which allows the user to easily return to the top in order to navigate somewhere else. The scrolling nature of the main content allows for the user to read through the content without interruption but still allows for easy navigation through the use of the provided navigation buttons.
